Note:
Fraudsters have been collecting data from investors trading in Forex, sending them bulk messages on the pretext of providing investment tips and luring them into investing in unauthentic entities with the promise of huge profits. Please do not trade on the basis of tips received via SMS. Take informed decisions through verified sources.
Do not issue cheques while subscribing to IPOs. Just mention the Bank Account Number and sign the Application Form, authorising your Bank to initiate the payment in case of allotment. This ensures zero hassle in refunds as the money continues to remain in your (the Investor’s) account.
Prevent unauthorised transactions in your Demat Account & Trading Account. Update your mobile number and e-mail ID with the Depository Participant / Stockbroker and receive alerts for all your transactions, directly from NSDL / CSDL / NSE on the same day.
Updating your KYC is important if you are trading in the securities market. Once KYC is completed with a SEBI registered intermediary, you will not have to undergo the entire process again for another intermediary.
