Home Loan FAQs

COLLAPSE ALL
What is a home loan?
A home loan is essentially a financing option where funds are provided to an individual or an entity for the purchase, construction, extension, or renovation of a residential or commercial property. Lenders provide funds upfront, and borrowers repay through monthly installments, usually over many years. It's crucial for prospective homeowners to understand the terms, interest rates, tenure, and eligibility criteria before applying.
How do I apply for a home loan?
You can apply for a Home Loan with ICICI Bank through multiple ways. Steps for each are listed below:
1. iMobile App
Log into the iMobile app
Click on the ‘Instant Loans tile under the ‘Transact’ tab
Scroll and search for your Home Loan
Customise your Loan amount and fill in the information in the relevant fields
Proceed to fee payment.
2. Internet Banking
Log into your Internet Banking account
Go to the ‘Loans’ section
Click on the ‘Home Loan’ tile
After getting redirected, enter the required details and proceed ahead to pay the login fee.
For new customers of ICICI Bank

Provide necessary information like your PAN, Date of Birth and Aadhaar Number
Read and accept the disclaimer and verify through OTP to complete the KYC
Select the loan option as per your financial requirement and proceed
Adjust the loan terms as per your financial standing
Provide additional details like income and property information
Pay the processing fee and submit.
The loan is provisionally sanctioned to your Account after the verification is complete.
2. Visit a Branch
Loan applications can also be made offline. Visit any ICICI Bank Branch to apply for the loan in person. Fill out the application form with standard paperwork and submit the application for approval.
What are the parameters for arriving at Home Loan eligibility?
Age:
21–65 years for salaried individuals
21–70 years for self-employed individuals
Income:
₹ 25,000 per month as minimum salary
₹ 30,000 per month as minimum income for a self-employed individual
Employment Stability:
A steady employment record or a steady track record of business
How is the Equated Monthly Instalment (EMI) for a Home Loan calculated?
EMI Calculation Formula with example:
The EMI is generally calculated using variables like the Loan amount, Loan interest rate, and tenure. The formula used is:
EMI = [P × r × (1 + r)^n] / [(1 + r)^n − 1]
where:
P
= Principal Loan amount
r
= Monthly interest rate (annual rate divided by 12)
n
= Loan tenure in months
Example
:
For a Home Loan of ₹ 20 lakh with a 9% annual interest rate (0.0075 monthly) and a 20-year tenure (240 months):
P
= ₹ 20,00,000
r
= 9% ÷ 12 = 0.0075
n
= 240
EMI = [20,00,000 × 0.0075 × (1 + 0.0075)^240] / [(1 + 0.0075)^240 − 1]
The EMI for this Loan would be approximately ₹
17,994.
What is Floating Rate of Interest on a Home Loan?
Floating Rate of Interest on a Home Loan means that the interest rate is not fixed and can change over time. The change takes place according to a benchmark rate/repo rate set by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) that can impact your overall monthly EMIs.
What is the meaning of a fixed rate of interest on a home loan?
A fixed rate of interest on a Housing loan means that the rate of interest does not change throughout the tenure of the loan. Regardless of market fluctuations, the borrower pays the same interest rate through the same equated monthly installments (EMIs) from the loan's inception to its conclusion. This stability provides predictability in monthly payments, allowing homeowners to plan their finances without being affected by interest rate variations in the market.
Is there any tax benefit available on home loans?
Yes, home loans offer tax benefits. You can claim the amount paid towards the repayment of the principal and the interest components as deductions in your income tax return. The limits on the amount deductible are governed by the applicable income tax laws.. In India, under Section 24(b), the interest paid on a home loan is eligible for deduction up to Rs 2 lakh per year. Additionally, under Section 80C, the principal repayment is eligible for a deduction of up to Rs 1.5 lakh. These tax benefits make home loans an attractive financial instrument, encouraging homeownership while providing potential savings on taxable income.
Do I need a guarantor for a Home Loan?
For ICICI Bank, the requirement of a guarantor for a Home Loan hinges upon several factors, notably the applicant's creditworthiness, income stability and the loan amount. Generally, a guarantor may not be necessary if the borrower fulfils the eligibility criteria of ICICI Bank. However, if the applicant's financial profile falls below the bank's standards, a guarantor could be requested to ensure loan repayment.
ICICI Bank assesses each application on its merits. Hence, consulting directly with our representative is recommended for complete guidance on your Home Loan application.
How long does it take to get a Home Loan sanctioned?
At ICICI Bank, the duration for sanctioning a Home Loan varies depending on several factors, such as the applicant’s documentation accuracy, credit history, property evaluation and the applicant's credit score.
Generally, the process can take one to two weeks. ICICI Bank usually requires thorough verification of the applicant's financial documents, such as income proof, identity proof and property documents. The time taken for property valuation and legal checks also contributes to the overall processing time. Applicants should provide all necessary documents promptly to expedite the
house loan process
.
What is the maximum housing loan I can get?
Your eligibility for a
housing loan
is determined by factors such as your income, credit score and the value of the property. Generally, lenders offer around 80% of the property's value. Your ability to repay and financial stability are crucial in deciding the loan amount you can receive.
How long does it take for a house loan to be disbursed?
The disbursement of a
house loan
depends on document verification, property assessment and how quickly the lender processes applications. Submitting all documents promptly can expedite the process.
Who is the co-applicant in a home loan?
A co applicant for a
loan for a hous
e is someone who applies for the loan, alongside the borrower, a spouse, parent or sibling. The co applicants income and credit history are taken into account potentially leading to a loan amount and favorable terms.
Can I repay my outstanding housing loan amount?
You have the option to repay your housing loan at any time. You can make full or partial prepayments to lower your interest expenses and shorten the repayment period. It's advisable to confirm with your lender regarding any prepayment penalties or terms.

I want to express my sincere appreciation for the Relationship Manager who assisted me with my Home Loan application. His follow-up and guidance was instrumental in making the loan process fast and efficient. It took less than two days for the sanction. The disbursement was quick, covering the legal and technical aspects which is not possible with other banks. Thank you for such dedicated support and exceptional service.

I availed Home Loan from ICICI Bank and I will highly recommend it. The application process was simple, documentation requirements were clear and the Bank's team was responsive and professional. The loan approval and disbursal were on time and the transparency of the terms and conditions was commendable. Overall, I had a hassle-free and satisfying experience with ICICI Bank Home Loan team. I am grateful for the support and assistance I have received from the dedicated team of ICICI Bank. I am looking forward to a long and trusted relationship with ICICI Bank.

ICICI Bank and its Relationship Manager made my Home Loan process as simple as it could be. It just took 3 weeks right from the first enquiry call to the loan disbursement. Hats off to the team for their prompt actions, timely reminders for documents, closure of tasks etc. I will share my wonderful experience with others and strongly recommend ICICI Bank Home Loan to everyone. Thanks team.

I wanted to thank the Relationship Manager of ICICI Bank for his outstanding professionalism, dedication and customer focused approach. I was a bit worried about buying property in India while I was based in the UK with the additional complication of Power of Attorney executed by aged parents. Our Relationship Manager took us through the whole process with complete clarity of inputs, documents and evidences required for execution. We were able to complete the process and register the property in a timely manner. Moving through the red tape and registering a property within a week of a person flying to India is like a miracle for an NRI.

I would like to thank my Relationship Manager for his help and guidance while processing my Home Loan application. The quick approach that he followed in processing my application is commendable. I was attended to with utmost professional attitude and perfection and all my queries were resolved. I especially appreciate his efforts that he made me feel extremely comfortable while discussing the procedures and comprehensive processes of documentation of Home Loans provided by ICICI Bank to NRIs.

Thank you very much for making our Home Loan experience hassle-free and convenient. I have taken Home Loans earlier from other banks, but this experience has been the best. ICICI Bank's vision, ‘Fair to Customers, Fair to Bank’ is very true and can be seen in practice. The commitment and sincerity shown by ICICI Bank employees is really appreciated.

Thanks to my Relationship Manager for all the help in getting my loan disbursed. I still remember the day when I told him about the property in Mysore and I was little sceptical whether the loan would be processed or not. His approach to the case and knowledge is what impressed me. His prompt responses to all my messages, questions, and guidance in making me understand the calculations were very helpful.
People like him are an asset to the organisation. All the best!!!

Thanks to my RM for helping me on my Mortgage Loan with the paperwork and closing it. I really liked her positive attitude and commitment to work. Excellent communication, coordination and ability to get things done distinguish her from the mass.
I loved the way she followed up with the customers and on top of it, collaborating with her teammates and making things happen. She is an asset to the NRI Mortgage team and ICICI Bank is lucky to have a team player like her. She understood that we have busy schedules and coordinated accordingly, making sure to update us at every step. She exemplifies the principles of ‘customer obsession’ and ‘ownership’. She treats every request with utmost professionalism and tries her best to deliver things. Wishing her all success in the current and future assignments.
