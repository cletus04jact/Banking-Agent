How can I pay my Credit Card bill?
You can pay your Credit Card bill through ICICI Bank Internet Banking, Scan to Pay (UPI), iMobile app, ATMs or NEFT. For non-ICICI Bank customers, use NEFT, 'Click to Pay' with Internet Banking or ‘Scan to Pay’ for timely settlements.
Should I pay my Credit Card in full?
By paying the full Credit Card bill, you can avoid interest charges. It's always wise to settle the complete amount. If you are unable to pay the entire amount, pay at least the ‘Minimum Due, to avoid penalties.
Can I pay the Credit Card bill immediately after purchase?
Yes, you can pay the bill immediately after a purchase, but the amount due will reflect in the next billing cycle. Paying promptly can help manage expenses efficiently.
When should I pay my Credit Card bill?
You should pay your Credit Card bill before the due date to avoid late fees and interest charges. Early payment ideally in full, keeps your credit record healthy and minimises financial burdens.
What is the ‘Minimum Due’ on Credit Cards?
The ‘Minimum Due’ is the smallest amount you need to pay by the due date to maintain a good credit standing. It's a fraction of the total bill and includes interest, fees and a percentage of the outstanding balance.
How to make payments through a Credit Card?
To make payments through a Credit Card, you have to first initiate a transaction on your card. On doing so, the card details are shared with the recipient Bank. The Bank processes the transaction through a payment network and authorises the transaction further with the card issuer. The issuer then verifies the transaction for acceptance or non-acceptance.
What is the ideal time to pay the Credit Card bill?
The Credit Card bill is generated every month, so it is recommended to pay the Credit Card bill every month before the due date, which is generally 15-20 days after the bill generation date. Timely payment of the Credit Card dues will help in maintaining a good credit score.
Can I pay the Credit Card dues through any other Bank Account?
Yes, you can pay your Credit Card dues through any other Bank Account, using the NEFT facility or other platforms like iMobile.
