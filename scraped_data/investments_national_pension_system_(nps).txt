For more details, explore the NPS pension scheme details and start your national pension system account online.
Types of NPS Accounts & Contributions
The National Pension System (NPS) offers two types of accounts: Tier 1 (mandatory) and Tier 2 (voluntary). A Tier II account requires a Tier I account and differs in tax benefits and withdrawal rules.
Tier 1 Account:
Government employees contribute 10% of their base pay plus DA, while others invest a minimum of Rs. 500 initially and Rs. 6,000 annually.
Tier 2 Account:
Does not offer tax breaks or matching contributions but allows flexible withdrawals anytime. Opening a Tier II account requires an initial payment of Rs. 1,000 and subsequent top-ups of Rs. 250, maintaining a yearly balance over Rs. 2,000.
National Pension System Benefits and Its Features
The National Pension System (NPS) offers a range of benefits and features that make it a top choice for retirement planning:
Regulated
: Managed under the PFRDA (Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority), the NPS is governed by transparent guidelines and regular monitoring by the NPS Trust.
Voluntary Participation
: Available or Open to all Indian residents, citizens between 18 to 70, the NPS scheme provides flexibility in investment amounts and timing according to their financial goals and risk tolerance.
Flexibility
: Choose or change your Point of Presence (POP), investment pattern, and fund manager to optimise returns.
Cost-effective
: Offering one of the lowest fees among other investment options, the NPS ensures economical long-term savings.
Portability
: Your National Pension System account and PRAN remain unchanged, even with job changes or relocations.
Superannuation Fund Transfer
: Allows tax-free transfer of superannuation funds to your NPS pension system account, subject to approvals.
Tax Advantages
: Triple tax benefits make the NPS a smart choice for reducing taxable income. NPS Scheme helps salaried employees individuals and self-employed individuals reduce their taxable income significantly;
Section 80CCD (1):
Claim up to 10% of basic salary + dearness allowance for employees; and up to 20% of gross annual income for self-employed people, both subject to a maximum limit of Rs. 1,50,000 under section 80C.
Section 80CCD (1B):
Enjoy additional tax deductions worth up to Rs. 50,000 beyond the limits set by section 80C.
NPS Account Investments Option
When planning your investments with the NPS scheme, you can choose between:
Active Choice
:
Offers the freedom to customise your portfolio across four asset classes: Equity (E), Corporate Bonds (C), Government Securities (G), and Alternate Assets (A).
Ideal for those investors confident about market movements, managing risk, and willing to assume the responsibility of balancing their portfolios.
You decide how much to allocate to each class based on risk tolerance and potential return: Equity (E) offers high returns with high risk, Government Securities (G) are low risk, and Alternate Assets (A) are highly volatile with a 5% cap.
Auto Choice (Life Cycle Fund)
:
Suitable for those hesitant or unfamiliar with actively designing their portfolios.
Allocation adjusts automatically based on age: higher equity exposure in younger years, reducing as you age to lower risk.
Three options are available: LC 75 (75% maximum equity exposure), LC 50 (moderate exposure), and LC 25 (conservative exposure) based on your risk tolerance.

Tax Benefits for Salaried Employees
Section 80CCD(1) - You can avail yourself of a tax deduction of a maximum of 10% of your salary and an allowance subject to a limit of Rs. 1.5 lakh.
Section 80CCD(1B) - In addition to that benefit is a deduction of Rs. 50,000 on top of the Rs. 1,50,000 limit in Section 80CCDB (I).
Section 80CCD(2) - In case your employer makes contributions to your NPS account also qualifies for a deduction beyond the limit of Rs. 1.5 lakh.
Tax Benefits for Self-Employed Individuals

Section 80CCD(2) - Any contributions you or your employer made to NPS also qualify for deductions.
Additional Perks
NPS enables you to access a tax withdrawal of up to 60% of your retirement funds and enjoy savings benefits while offering flexible contribution options suitable for both employees and self employed individuals alike. Additionally providing advantages such as management fees for funds and the ability to transfer accounts easily along with exposure to equities for returns and the option for partial withdrawals, in case of emergencies ensures a stable financial future during retirement.
NPS Scheme Corporate Benefits
The Corporate NPS model is a variation of the National Pension System established by the Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA). It enables companies to offer their employees a defined retirement savings plan that's tax efficient as part of their benefits package. With this program, employers can play a role in securing their employees’ future while also enjoying benefits in terms of retirement savings and tax perks. The Corporate NPS model simplifies the way businesses provide retirement benefits through the employer to worker connection and is becoming increasingly popular for its flexibility and cost efficiency for companies as its valuable financial rewards for employees.
Key Corporate Benefits of the NPS Model
Cost effectiveness
A key advantage of the Corporate NPS model is its cost effectiveness, for businesses compared to retirement plans in the market. Unlike pension schemes that come with additional administrative and fund management fees the NPS does not burden companies with such extra costs. This feature makes it a compelling choice for organisations looking to offer retirement benefits while keeping their expenses in check. Opting for NPS allows companies to secure coverage, for their employees without putting pressure on company resources.
Ease of setup
Establishing the Corporate NPS framework is simple and convenient, without any complications involved in comparison to retirement plans where separate trusts are necessary for overseeing staff donations by companies themselves. The NPS model offers a procedure for including or excluding employees from the system which simplifies the management as your staff evolves over time. This ease enables companies of all sizes, ranging from startups to established corporations to seamlessly introduce and oversee the program with ease.
●
Personalisation
The Corporate NPS model offers a level of customisation to meet the requirements of employers and employees alike. Employers have the flexibility to determine the contribution structure—be it a percentage of the employees pay or an optional participation method. Employees are also empowered to tailor their NPS investments by selecting their contribution amounts and deciding on asset classes like stocks, government bonds, or corporate securities for their investments. This customisation ensures that the strategy aligns with the objectives of both the company and its staff members.
NPS Tax Benefits for Employers and Employees
For Corporates
One major benefit of implementing the Corporate NPS program is the tax advantages it offers to the company. Companies have the option to contribute a maximum of 10% of an employees salary and dearness allowance to NPS. These contributions are entirely exempt from taxes under Section 80CCD (2). This feature not only helps organisations in handling their tax responsibilities but also enables them to offer important retirement benefits to their employees without facing substantial financial strains.
For Employees
Employees also receive tax advantages through NPS as their contributions qualify for tax deductions under sections of the Income Tax Act in India. For example in Section 80CCD(1B) employees can seek a deduction of up to Rs. 50,000 in addition to the existing Rs 1.5 lakh limit under Section 80 C. These deductions enhance the appeal of NPS as a tax investment option for employees by enabling them to lower their income and simultaneously create a robust retirement corpus.
