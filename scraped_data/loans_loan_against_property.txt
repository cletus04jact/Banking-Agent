Types of Loan Against Property
LAP for Doctors
ICICI Bank provides a Loan Against Property for doctors, allowing a loan sanction of up to 75% of the property value. If you own a property as a doctor and need funds for clinic expansion or other financial needs, you can apply for a higher Loan amount with a 15-year term.
Home Overdraft
The LAP OD facility has a financing option that allows you to withdraw a certain amount from the sanctioned limit. This facility has a long-term dropline limit that gets auto-renewed every year at minimum charges. The interest rate is applicable only on the amount you utilise to finance your needs.
LAP Top-up
You can also take a Top-up Loan on your existing Loan Against Property. If you are facing a shortage of funds for personal or business purposes, a Top-up Loan is the ideal choice. It requires minimal documentation, especially if you already have an ongoing LAP with ICICI Bank.

What is Loan Against Property (LAP)?
A Loan Against Property is a Secured Loan, where you can mortgage your residential, commercial or special use property to get immediate funds for any purpose, ranging from business expenditure to personal needs. In LAP, the property you own, which has a clear title, is kept with ICICI Bank as a collateral or security, to help you get financial assistance.
What is the maximum term for which I can take a Loan Against Property (LAP)?
Applicants can avail a Loan Against Property for a maximum period of 15 years. This gives you flexibility so you can select a repayment plan that works best for your budget. You can conveniently manage your loan and get the money you need with this longer term.
What is the security that I need to provide to take a Loan Against Property (LAP)?
As the name suggests, you need to mortgage your property, to ensure access to immediate funding. Your property will act as a security against the Loan amount that you are seeking to apply with ICICI Bank. It can be either a residential, commercial or special use space, which is well constructed, has a clear title and free from any legal complications.
What type of property can I mortgage for a LAP?
ICICI Bank allows you to secure a mortgage Loan Against Property by mortgaging residential, commercial or a special use property (owned or rented). If you own any property like schools, warehouses, industrial or nursing you are eligible to get the Loan.
Do ICICI Bank offer Property Loan as an overdraft?

What percentage of the property value can I avail as a LAP?
ICICI Bank offers a loan amount of up to
75% of the property value
. The loan amount, which you can avail through ICICI Bank’s LAP depends on the overall condition of the property. This is nothing but the Loan to Value or LTV Ratio, which ICICI Bank refers to before approving any loan. Also, LTV ratios differ by the type of property. Age and prevailing market value of the property also comes under assessment. You can use a
mortgage loan calculator
to know how much loan you can avail.
For what purposes can I take a LAP Loan?
A LAP can be availed for various purposes such as a wedding, child’s higher studies, medical emergency, buying a new home, business expansion, debt consolidation to lower cash outflows, purchase of medical equipment and much more.
