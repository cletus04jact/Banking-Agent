Can I get 100% funding to buy a car?
100% on-road funding on Vehicle Loans is possible based on parameters like income, stability, FOIR, CIBIL and internal checks.
What is the maximum Loan amount that can be availed for a new car?
As no upper limit is prescribed for Loans to buy a new Car, it depends on the cost of the vehicle. E.g., if the on-road price of a Car is Rs 20 lakh, a customer can avail Rs 20 lakh on a case-to-case basis.
What is the Loan Tenure to buy a new car?
The Tenure ranges from 12 to 84 months to secure a New Car Loan.
What is the minimum credit score to get a Car Loan?
Credit score
is one of the key factors to get a Car Loan approved. However, it would also depend on other parameters and on the reason why the applicant has a low credit score.
How much down payment needs to be made to buy a car?
The down payment would vary from car to car. However, before the disbursal of a Car Loan a margin money receipt is required from the car dealer.
When applying for a Vehicle Loan, is a guarantor required?
This would be determined on a case-to-case basis. Generally, Co-applicants are preferred in Vehicle Loan cases and a Guarantor will be considered if required.
