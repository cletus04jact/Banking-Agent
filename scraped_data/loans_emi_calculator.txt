What is a Personal Loan EMI?
EMI or Equated Monthly Instalment is the amount that is payable per month, if you avail a
Personal Loan
for a certain period. The EMI amount will be used to pay off both the Principal Loan Amount and the Personal Loan Interest over the loan tenure, until the loan is paid in full. The EMI will remain the same throughout the tenure.
What is a Personal Loan EMI Calculator?
A Personal Loan EMI Calculator is an online tool to calculate the EMI amount a borrower has to pay every month to repay the loan. The EMI Calculator considers the loan amount, interest rate and loan tenure to compute the EMI and interest payable for the entire loan tenure (assuming fixed rate throughout the tenure). By using this Personal Loan EMI Calculator, you can finalise your required loan amount, as per your affordability by inputting different loan amounts, interest rates and loan tenures and arriving at a suitable EMI amount.
How is Personal Loan EMI calculated?
Personal Loan EMI is typically calculated using the reducing balance method, where interest is computed on the outstanding loan amount. Although the EMI remains fixed, the principal repayment grows while the interest portion declines over time. The formula used for this calculation is:
EMI = P × r × (1 + r)^n / ((1 + r)^n - 1)
where,
P - the principal loan amount,
r - the monthly interest rate (annual rate divided by 12)
n - loan tenure in months.
How is the interest on a Personal Loan calculated?
Personal Loan interest calculation takes into consideration factors like principal amount, tenure and applied interest rate, thus helping you to determine the total repayment amount. Once you know all the details, you can use a Personal Loan Interest Rate Calculator to get accurate results regarding the interest payments.
What are the benefits of using a Personal Loan EMI Calculator?
A Personal Loan EMI Calculator offers the following benefits:
- It simplifies financial planning.
- It accurately determines monthly instalments.
- It ensures better budget management.
- It helps in making informed decisions.
What are the factors that can affect your Personal Loan EMI?
EMI is the monthly amount you pay for a specific loan amount and duration. The calculation of EMI depends on 6 main factors:
1. Loan amount:
The total value of your Personal Loan
2. Interest rate:
The rate charged by the Bank on your Personal Loan
3. Tenure:
The duration for which you opt for a Personal Loan
4. Income:
Your income directly impacts the loan amount
5. Age:
Younger individuals often get longer loan repayment periods due to their age
6. Credit score:
A higher credit score boosts loan approval chances and lowers interest rates, positively affecting your EMI calculations.
What is the EMI for a Rs 2 lakh Personal Loan?

Rs 2 lakh Personal Loan

What is the EMI for a Rs 10 lakh Personal Loan?
The EMI calculation for
Rs 10 lakh Personal Loan
depends on factors like your loan amount, tenure and interest rate. The higher the interest rate, the higher the EMI. You can get attractive rates if you have a higher CIBIL score.
What is the EMI for a Rs 20 lakh Personal Loan?
The EMI calculation for a
Rs 20 lakh Personal Loan

What is the minimum salary requirement for a Rs 20 lakh Personal Loan?

Monthly obligations and tenure have a significant influence on the loan amount.

Budget making:
Estimating monthly payments for loans can be tough. This is where the EMI tool can help you plan your finances and ensure that you can afford the loan payments.
