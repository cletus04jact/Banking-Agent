What are Mutual Funds?
Mutual Funds are investment pools where money from various investors is collected and then invested in a diversified portfolio of assets like stocks and bonds. Investors in Mutual Funds own shares of the fund, which, in turn, owns shares in other companies or government bonds.
The investors cannot directly own the stocks held by the fund. They share in the profits or losses of the entire fund equally. This shared ownership model is why they are called 'Mutual Funds,' offering investors a way to access a diversified portfolio without needing to directly manage individual mutual fund investments.

These are some of the factors that an investor should consider when it comes to investing in Mutual Funds (MFs) in India.

Start by identifying your investment objectives. Equities offer high returns but come with higher risks, while bond funds provide stability amidst market volatility.
Considering Time Horizon
Align your investment horizon with your goals. Long-term objectives suit growth-oriented equity funds, while mid-term goals benefit from a balanced portfolio. Short-term goals necessitate a mix of bonds for stability.

Is Mutual Fund a good investment?
Mutual Funds are a good investment option for investors looking to diversify their portfolios. Instead of taking exposure to only one company or industry, a Mutual Fund investor invests in different securities and minimises your portfolio's risk.
How are returns earned in Mutual Funds?
Mutual Fund returns are calculated by computing appreciation in the value of your investments over a period as compared to the initial investment. The
Net Asset Value
of Mutual Fund indicates its price and is used in calculating returns for your Mutual Fund investments. Using a
MF Calculator
, you can easily calculate the returns on your mutual fund investment.
Are Mutual Funds taxable?
By investing in Mutual Funds, an investor can earn returns in the form of capital gains and dividend** income, which are taxable in the hands of the investor.
A capital gain / loss arises when an investor sells any number of units of Mutual Funds
An investor receives a dividend in proportion to the number of units held at the time of announcement of dividend, which is distributed by companies to investors when they earn a surplus.
Tax on Capital Gains Received from Mutual Funds:
The tax on capital gains depends on the period of holding (short-term or long-term) and the type of capital asset.
In the case of Equity Mutual Funds, an investment tenure of less than 1 year (12 months) is a short-term investment. Any investment of over one year is a
long-term investment
In case of Debt and Hybrid Mutual Funds, an investment tenure of up to 2 years (24 months) is a short-term investment and any investment of over 2 years (24 months) is considered as long-term.

**Tax on Dividend Income received from Mutual Funds:
From Apr 1, 2020, Mutual Fund dividends are taxable in the hands of investors. The dividend income is taxable under the head ‘income from other sources’ at the applicable income tax slab rate for the financial year
Income Distribution-cum-Capital Withdrawal (IDCW) is a term used by Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) to replace dividend option in Mutual Fund.
Disclaimer: The Union Budget 2024 has introduced significant changes to the taxation of Mutual Funds, aiming to simplify the tax structure and provide clarity for investors. These changes impact various
types of Mutual Funds
differently, altering how they are taxed over both the short and long term. Investors can learn how Mutual Funds are taxed if they are concerned that their returns from Mutual Funds will be reduced after paying taxes.
What is the best way to choose a Mutual Fund that suits your financial objective?
Selecting a Mutual Fund is a two-step process – selection of the Mutual Fund category and selection of a scheme in that category.
Select the Mutual Fund category on the basis of the investment objective, time horizon and risk tolerance.
After selecting the Mutual Fund category, choose a Mutual Fund scheme within that category on the basis of its relative performance vs benchmark & its category and consistency of performance. The other important aspect in the scheme selection process is the AMC track record, fund manager’s experience, scheme’s Asset Under Management (AUM) & Expense ratio.
What is SIP in Mutual Funds?
SIP
stands for Systematic Investment Plan. It is a method of investing in Mutual Funds (MFs) and involves regularly investing a fixed amount at predetermined intervals, generally monthly. SIPs are popular for letting investors invest in a disciplined manner and they also offer the chance to generate long-term wealth.
Is Mutual Fund Investment Profitable?
Mutual funds can be profitable investments, but success also depends on selecting the appropriate fund and maintaining a long-term perspective. However, profitability is influenced by factors like fund management and market conditions. It's important to understand that mutual funds are susceptible to market fluctuations, meaning their value may decline if underlying assets falter. Using a mutual fund calculator can help in monitoring the progress of the fund.
How can I check my Mutual Fund status?
You can check your status through ICICI Bank digital platforms as below:
iMobile : log in to the app, move to the ‘Invest’ section and select ‘Mutual Funds’. Click on ‘My SIPs’ to view your portfolio details.
