Joining/Annual Fee
The Joining Fee is an initial cost to own the Card. It varies from bank to bank and on the type of card you apply for. It is usually followed by an Annual Charge.
Interest Charge
Interest Charges are levied on all new transactions and on outstanding dues, due to non-payment by the due date. The maximum charge is 3.75%, per month.
Late Payment Fee
If you are unable to pay the outstanding amount, the Bank will notify you to pay the minimum amount. In case you fail to pay the minimum amount, a late payment fee is charged.
